# FBS: a Frenquency-Based Search on Protein DDGP binary trees.

Python notebook that generates the experiments in

A probabilistic search on the solution space of the Molecular Distance Geometry Problem,

by Rômulo S. Marques, Michael Souza, Fernando Baptista, Miguel Gonçalves, and Carlile Lavor.

It collects the occurrency probabilities of

short DDGP binary substrings associated with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)

instances available on the [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/).
