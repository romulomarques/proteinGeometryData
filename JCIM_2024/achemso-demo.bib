abstract = {Knowledge of three-dimensional protein structures is one of the foundations of protein design and protein engineering. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was recently introduced as a second method for protein structure determination, in addition to the well-established diffraction techniques with protein single crystals. This new approach enables one to carry out detailed structural studies of proteins in solution and other noncrystalline states, which may be similar or identical to the physiological environment, and promises new insights into the dynamics of protein molecules and the protein-folding problem.}}
